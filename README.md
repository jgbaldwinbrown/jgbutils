##Utilities for genomic analysis
Included here are various utilities developed by me for genomic analysis. I have separated these utilities by project, then by use. Most programs are written in Python 2.7 or R. Documentation is largely incomplete -- read the first few lines of a script if the command line inputs are unclear.

##Functioning Scripts
Scripts from Chakraborty et al. 2016 are functional, but all other scripts are, for the moment, strictly experimental and should be used at your own risk.
